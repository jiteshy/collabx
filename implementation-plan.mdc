   - Status: Completed
   - Summary: Created feature-based folder structure
   - Summary: Moved socket logic to dedicated service

3. [x] Enhance type safety
   - Create comprehensive types for socket events
   - Add strict type checking for editor state
   - Implement proper type guards

## Phase 2: Quality & Testing
4. [x] Set up testing infrastructure
   - Configure Jest and React Testing Library
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Implement integration tests for socket communication
   - Add end-to-end tests with Cypress

## Progress Tracking
- Total Tasks: 10
- Completed: 6
- In Progress: 0
- Pending: 4

## Notes
- Each phase should be completed before moving to the next
- All changes should be tested thoroughly before deployment
- Existing functionality must be preserved throughout the implementation
- Each task should be completed in a separate branch and reviewed before merging
- Run unit tests after every change and fix any issue introduced.
